# 3D Hockey Game Development

This document outlines the development of a complete 3D hockey game, starting with fixing the rink texture issue and expanding into a fully playable game.

## Goals
1. **Immediate**: Fix the rink texture rendering to show proper NHL markings
2. **Core Gameplay**: Create a fun, playable hockey game with:
   - Player-controlled paddles with team colors
   - Realistic puck physics (sliding, friction, bouncing)
   - Responsive keyboard controls
   - Collision detection between puck and paddles
   - Goals with nets at each end
   - Score tracking and game state
3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Sound effects for immersion
   - AI opponent for single-player mode
   - Visual effects like ice spray particles

## Steps Taken

1.  **Initial Setup:**
    *   Created an `index.html` and `main.js` file.
    *   Set up a basic Three.js scene with a camera, renderer, and lighting.
    *   Created a simple blue plane for the rink, a puck, and a player paddle.

2.  **First Texture Attempt:**
    *   Replaced the blue plane with a textured plane using a URL for a generic NHL rink texture.
    *   **Issue:** The texture did not appear, the rink remained a solid color.

3.  **Overhead View and Sideboards:**
    *   Changed the camera position to a top-down (overhead) view for a clearer perspective.
    *   Added four white boxes to act as sideboards around the rink.
    *   **Issue:** The texture still did not appear.

4.  **Multiple Texture Attempts:**
    *   Tried several different image URLs for the rink texture, assuming the initial one might be broken.
    *   **Issue:** None of the textures would render on the rink plane.

5.  **Robust Loading with LoadingManager:**
    *   To rule out timing issues, a `LoadingManager` was implemented in Three.js.
    *   This ensures that the `animate` function (the game loop) does not start until all assets, including the texture, are fully loaded.
    *   A new texture URL was used in this implementation.
    *   **Issue:** The texture still failed to display, even with the loading manager.

6.  **Improving Visibility:**
    *   The scene's background color was changed to light gray.
    *   The ambient and directional lighting were made significantly brighter.
    *   The rink material's base color was changed to white to make the ice appear brighter.
    *   **Issue:** While the overall scene is brighter, the fundamental problem of the texture not rendering remains.

## Current Status
We have a scene with an overhead view of a white plane representing the rink, surrounded by white sideboards, and a puck. The texture with rink markings isn't rendering despite multiple attempts.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Foundation (Priority: High)
1. **Fix rink texture issue** - Try programmatic approach if external textures continue to fail
2. **Add player paddles** - Two paddles with distinct team colors (red vs blue)
3. **Implement basic controls** - Arrow keys for player 1, WASD for player 2

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay (Priority: High)
4. **Add puck physics** - Implement sliding with friction and wall bouncing
5. **Create goals** - Add goal structures with nets at each end
6. **Collision detection** - Handle puck-paddle and puck-goal interactions
7. **Game state & scoring** - Track score, handle goals, game timer

### Phase 3: Polish (Priority: Medium-Low)
8. **Sound effects** - Puck hits, goal horn, crowd cheers
9. **AI opponent** - Basic AI for single-player mode
10. **Visual effects** - Ice spray particles, better lighting, shadows

## Next Steps
Begin with fixing the texture issue using a programmatic approach to draw the rink markings directly.
