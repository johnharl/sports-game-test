# Rink Texture and Display Issues

This document outlines the steps taken to create a 3D hockey rink and the unresolved issues with texture rendering.

## Goal
The primary goal was to create a 3D representation of an NHL hockey rink with all the correct markings (center circle, blue lines, red line, goal lines, etc.) and sideboards.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Initial Setup:**
    *   Created an `index.html` and `main.js` file.
    *   Set up a basic Three.js scene with a camera, renderer, and lighting.
    *   Created a simple blue plane for the rink, a puck, and a player paddle.

2.  **First Texture Attempt:**
    *   Replaced the blue plane with a textured plane using a URL for a generic NHL rink texture.
    *   **Issue:** The texture did not appear, the rink remained a solid color.

3.  **Overhead View and Sideboards:**
    *   Changed the camera position to a top-down (overhead) view for a clearer perspective.
    *   Added four white boxes to act as sideboards around the rink.
    *   **Issue:** The texture still did not appear.

4.  **Multiple Texture Attempts:**
    *   Tried several different image URLs for the rink texture, assuming the initial one might be broken.
    *   **Issue:** None of the textures would render on the rink plane.

5.  **Robust Loading with LoadingManager:**
    *   To rule out timing issues, a `LoadingManager` was implemented in Three.js.
    *   This ensures that the `animate` function (the game loop) does not start until all assets, including the texture, are fully loaded.
    *   A new texture URL was used in this implementation.
    *   **Issue:** The texture still failed to display, even with the loading manager.

6.  **Improving Visibility:**
    *   The scene's background color was changed to light gray.
    *   The ambient and directional lighting were made significantly brighter.
    *   The rink material's base color was changed to white to make the ice appear brighter.
    *   **Issue:** While the overall scene is brighter, the fundamental problem of the texture not rendering remains.

## Current Status
We have a scene with an overhead view of a white plane representing the rink, surrounded by white sideboards, and a puck. The core issue is that the texture image with the rink markings is not being applied to the rink plane, despite multiple attempts with different textures and loading strategies.
