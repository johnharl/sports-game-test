# 3D Hockey Game - Completed Features

## Project Summary
What started as a texture rendering issue has evolved into a fully-featured 3D hockey game with professional polish.

## Completed Features âœ…

### Phase 1: Foundation
- **Rink Texture Fix**: Implemented programmatic NHL-accurate rink markings using Canvas API
- **Player Paddles**: Blue and red team paddles with metallic materials
- **Controls**: Responsive keyboard controls (Arrow keys + WASD)

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay
- **Puck Physics**: Realistic sliding with friction (0.98) and wall bouncing
- **Professional Goals**: Realistic goal structures with wireframe nets
- **Collision Detection**: Smooth puck-paddle collisions with proper physics
- **Game State**: Live score tracking, timer display, and goal detection

### Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement
- **Sound Effects**: Dynamic audio using Web Audio API
  - Puck hit sounds (200Hz square wave)
  - Goal horn (dual oscillator at 220Hz/330Hz)
  - Wall bounce sounds (150Hz triangle wave)
- **AI Opponent**: Strategic single-player mode
  - Defensive positioning when puck on AI side
  - Returns to center when puck on player side
  - 85% of human speed for balanced gameplay
- **Particle Effects**: Ice spray when players turn quickly
  - 100-particle pool system
  - Velocity-based emission
  - Gravity-affected particles

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Three.js with WebGL renderer
- **View**: Fixed overhead camera at (0, 18, 0)
- **Rink**: 30x15 units with 1-unit high boards

### Game Modes
- **Two Player**: Both players use keyboard
- **Single Player**: Player vs AI (Press 1/2 to switch)

### Controls
- **Player 1 (Blue)**: Arrow Keys
- **Player 2 (Red)**: WASD or AI
- **Space**: Reset puck
- **1**: Single player mode
- **2**: Two player mode
